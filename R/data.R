#' Collection of germline V DNA sequences
#' 
#' ungapped V-gene DNA sequences taken November 2020 from the IMGT webserver, for the following species: Bos_taurus, Gallus_gallus, Homo_sapiens, Mus_musculus, Oryctolagus_cuniculus, Sus_scrofa.
#'
#' @format a list of 6 entries named by the organism names listed in the description above (notice the underscore between binomial names). Each entry is a named list of character strings holding the sequences. V gene (e.g. IGHV1-1) are names of this list.
